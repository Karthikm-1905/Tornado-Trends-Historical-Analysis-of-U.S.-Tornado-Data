# Tornado Data Exploration and Analysis
This project involves a comprehensive analysis of historical tornado data (1950â€“2019) using Python and R. Through data exploration and visualization, it uncovers trends and insights in tornado occurrences, magnitudes, and impacts across the United States.

# Project Overview-
The project is divided into two main parts:

# Python Analysis:
1. Annual Tornado Count: Counts of tornadoes per year.
2. Monthly Tornado Trends: Identification of the month with the highest tornado occurrences.
3. Statewise Tornado Distribution: States with the highest frequency of tornadoes.
4. Severe Tornado Analysis: Analysis of F4 tornado occurrences by state.
5. Relationship Between Tornado Length and Width: Scatter plot to observe possible correlations.
6. Time-of-Day Analysis: Common times for tornado occurrences.

# R Analysis:
1. Data Summary: Summary statistics and boxplots for tornado length and width.
2. Injury and Fatality Statistics by Magnitude: Crosstab of average injuries and fatalities per tornado magnitude.
3. Loss by Magnitude: Visual representation of losses by tornado magnitude.
4. State Analysis: Identification of states with the highest injuries (Texas, Alabama, Oklahoma) and fatalities (Alabama, Texas, Mississippi).
5. Trends Over Time: Examination of the overall trend in tornado occurrences from 1950 through 2019.

# Getting Started-
Prerequisites
Python: Python 3.x, Pandas, Matplotlib
R: R and required libraries for data visualization

# Installation-
1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tornado-data-exploration.git

2. Install Python requirements:
pip install pandas matplotlib

3. Ensure you have R installed and the required libraries.

# Usage-
Load the dataset (1950-2019_actual_tornadoes.csv) into the project directory.
For Python Analysis, run the following:
python tornado_analysis.py
For R Analysis, open the R script (tornado_analysis.R) and execute it in an R environment.

# Results-

The project produces various plots and tables, including:
1. Tornado frequency over time, by month, and by state.
2. Analysis of tornado magnitude impacts (injuries, fatalities, financial loss).
3. Trends in tornado dimensions (length and width) and common times for occurrences.

# Final Report-
The final report in PDF format, including detailed explanations, visualizations, and insights from both Python and R analyses, is available in the repository.

# Contributing-
