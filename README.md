# Tornado-Trends-Historical-Analysis-of-U.S.-Tornado-Data
This project performs an in-depth analysis of historical tornado data (from 1950 to 2019) using Python libraries like Pandas and Matplotlib. The project investigates various trends and statistics related to tornado occurrences in the United States, including annual frequency, monthly trends, state distributions, tornado intensity, and more.

Project Overview
The analysis includes:    
1. Annual Tornado Count: Counts of tornadoes per year.
2. Monthly Tornado Trends: Identification of the month with the highest tornado occurrences.
3. Statewise Tornado Distribution: States with the highest frequency of tornadoes.
4. Severe Tornado Analysis: Analysis of F4 tornado occurrences by state.
5. Relationship Between Tornado Length and Width: Scatter plot to observe possible correlations.
6. Time-of-Day Analysis: Common times for tornado occurrences.    

Getting Started:
Prerequisites:
1. Python 3.x
2. Pandas
3. Matplotlib

Installation:
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tornado-data-exploration.git

Install the required libraries:
1. Copy code
2. pip install pandas matplotlib

Usage:
1. Load the provided dataset (1950-2019_actual_tornadoes.csv) into the project directory.
2. Run the analysis script to generate plots and insights:

python tornado_analysis.py

Results:
The project outputs several visualizations to help interpret tornado trends and answer questions such as:
1. How has tornado frequency changed over time?
2. Which months and states are most affected.
3. The relationship between tornado dimensions (length and width).
4. The common times of day for tornado occurrences.
